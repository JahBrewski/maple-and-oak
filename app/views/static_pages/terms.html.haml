      .panel-body
        %p The membership of The Maple and Oak Network succeeds because of the quality of its members and some basic rules that everyone adheres to. We reserve the right to deny service to any member or prospective member at any time if they do not play by the rules.
        %p No Soliciting. Do not offer to "sell" anything to a member upon first contact. Focus on introducing yourself and the benefits you provide, not outwardly hawking a product or service. 
        %p No Misrepresentation. Please be as honest and forthright about yourself and your offer as possible. Members are encouraged to report any communications that they consider to be misleading or any members that appear to be misrepresenting themselves.
        %p No Leeches. A leech is someone who doesn’t respect the interests of the community and attempts to abuse the system for their own benefit. They take constantly and offer nothing in return. The Network succeeds because of our community’s ability to give. Don’t be a leech.

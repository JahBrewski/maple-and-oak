I was looking at the site just now and I noticed that the pictures are still of trees and not restaurant/bar space.
The about page is still blank, can we add pictures to the background of the contact and about page.
 
Your’s and Kristens logo’s aren’t up, where we were going to put the add space. 

the mapleandoak.com site is a go daddy page, can we make that to a coming soon, that’s one of the stipulations for the best test site you sent me. 

can we make the profile pages something other than stark white. A blue or a green?

When someone deletes their account, how long does it keep charging them? They do the 3 month trial, we get their CC, charge them for the 4th month on the 15th of every month and they cancel on the 13th? Will they be charged again?
